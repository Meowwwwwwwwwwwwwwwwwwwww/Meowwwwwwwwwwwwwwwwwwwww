### 🦠 Since 2022: The Post-Pandemic Pivot

While the world was gradually emerging from the shadows of COVID-19, I started diving deep into tech — turning isolation into innovation.

- 🚀 Learned to automate tasks that were once manual.
- 🌐 Explored the world of DevOps, cloud-native tools, and full-stack engineering.
- 📚 Built my foundation on Python, Kotlin, and system design.
- 🤖 Started creating intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.

> The pandemic may have shut the world down, but it powered up a new mindset — one that builds, iterates, and never stops learning.
